## TOMCAT - Application sever


.jar : simple java archive
.war : web archive
.ear : enterprise java archive

- Tomcat is a tool that only understand .war packages
-If extension is .jar or .ear then Tomcat will not be compatible for testing. Othe tools would have to be used.
- Tomcat is written in java so java has to be installed first on the server to run tomcat
- Available on port 8080
- Cant have two application running on same port concurrently. ( like have two users with same phonenumber!)
-If doing deployment through CLI need to understand the directory structure in which to deploy tomcat
- Directories availavel are bin,,, conf,,,lib,,,webapps,,,
- Artefact shoukd be in the webapps directory
- Once artefact is in the webapps dir, automatically it is unleached and QA can access the app
- To reach the app test team goes to http://pubipQA:8080/devops
- Running this command reveals the webapp ( ed application portal for UFH ) then uses the pageto run tests us
- Webapps hosts the artefacts: dir in which we deploy the atefact
